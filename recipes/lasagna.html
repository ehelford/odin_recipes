    <h5>This is my mother's wonderful lasagna recipe. It has been a favorite in our family for years!</h5>
    
    <p>This was excellent! I've only made lasagna one other time and this was so much better. I did use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese only because of what I remember about eating cottage and peaches as a snack as a kid (ARGH). Never want cottage cheese again. Instead of no-bake noodle or boiling the noodles, I placed them in room temperature water for about 40 minutes and that worked great. (got this from someone else on AllRecipes) I added about 1 teaspoon of basil and a bay leaf to the sauce while it simmered. Be sure to remove the bay leaf! Since it's only me and my 21 year old son at home, I have a lot of leftovers and it was exceptional the next day. I also shared with my niece and her 2 year old and they loved it!</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>  In a large pot over medium heat, cook beef until brown. Drain off all fat. Add onion and cook until translucent. Add tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, water, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir until combined and cook over medium heat until boiling. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour.</li>


  <li>While sauce is simmering, blend cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg until smooth. Set aside.</li>


    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>


        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>


            <li>Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover sauce with 3 noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the remaining sauce. Top with 1/2 of the mozzarella. Place another layer of noodles and one of sauce over the mozzarella; top that with the cottage cheese mixture. Top with remaining 3 noodles and remaining sauce.</li>
